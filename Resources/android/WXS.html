  <h2><strong>About WxS services</strong></h2>
  <p align="justify">The WMS and WCS mobile clients use a set of views to show layer and coverages supporting interaction with the user. The user can switch from a view to another following a well defined path, views are hierarchically organized and the user can switch only to the previous view and to the next view, in the view hierarchy, starting from one currently visualized. <br />
  The WMS and the WCS mobile client apps were initially developed as standalone mobile applications and then merged into a more effective and strongly integrated WxS mobile client.</p>
  <p>WxS Settings window shows a table listing the operations that the user can perform:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Change the opacity of layer/coverage in the stack</li>
    <li>Add a new WMS Layer</li>
    <li>Add a new WCS Coverage</li>
    <li>Add a new WMS/WCS Server</li>
    <li>View servers metadata</li>
    <li>View layers and coverages metadata</li>
  </ul>
