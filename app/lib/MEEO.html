  <h2><strong>Coverages info</strong></h2>
  <p align="justify">General information on the production of air quality forecast and analysis over Europe. The MACC regional air quality (<a href="http://macc-raq.gmes-atmosphere.eu">http://macc-raq.gmes-atmosphere.eu</a>) production is based on seven state-of-the-art numerical air quality models developed in Europe: CHIMERE by INERIS (France), EMEP by MET Norway (Norway), EURAD-IM by University of Cologne (Germany), LOTOS-EUROS by KNMI (Netherlands), MATCH by SMHI (Sweden), MOCAGE by Météo-France (France) and SILAM at FMI(Finland). The seven model forecasts and analyses are combined via an ensemble approach, that provides on average better estimates of air pollutant concentrations than the individual models. </p>

  <h2><strong>Products</strong></h2>
  <p align="justify">The Climate Data Service provides MACC regional air quality forecasts over Europe (30°N - 70°N, 25°W - 45°E): ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matters (PM10 and PM2.5) at surface, at 500m, 1000m and 3000m altitude, on an hourly basis. </p>
